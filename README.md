# MeHelpa
MeHelpa is a collaborative platform where university students can connect, share academic questions, and interact on projects across different courses. Similar to a blog, users can post messages that are visible to the entire university community, allowing others to respond, collaborate, and exchange knowledge in a supportive environment.
